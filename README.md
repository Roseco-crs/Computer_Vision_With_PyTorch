# Machine Learning (Computer Vision) With PyTorch


### Objective
- Install necessary PyTorch libraries
- Use PyTorch to build, train, and evaluate neural networks
- Save the trained model parameters and use them later for inferencing


### Different Steps during this project

1. Download the MNIST dataset and create a DataLoader for the dataset
2. Define an AI model to recognize a hand written digit.
3. Train the defined AI model using training data from the MNIST dataset 
4. Test the trained AI model using testing data from the MNIST dataset
5. Evaluate
